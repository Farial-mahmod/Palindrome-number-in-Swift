# Palindrome-number-in-Swift

Wikipedia definition of Palindrome "A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or another sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward" .
Example: madam or [1,2,2,1] .

## Process & Logic:
This is a Swift program that checks if a number is Palindrome . It takes the number in the form of an array and loops through the array to match the given numbers . If the first and the last character match, then the loop continues to check whether the character at first+1 and the character at last-1 match or not. 
This process continues to traverse all the elements in the form of an array.

## Output:
Palindrome if the reverse of the given phrase or number is equal to the given phrase / number .
Not a Palindrome if the reverse of the given phrase or number is unequal to the given phrase / number .
